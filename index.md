# Hello World!

## Welcome to **Tarun Murugesan's** GitHub Pages Portfolio!

By visiting my website. I hope you:
- enjoy reading through the work I've done
- follow along my `coding` journey throughout `CSE 15L`
- and, most importantly, **HAVE FUN!**

As I am quite new to programming, I try to maintain a positive learning mindset throughout all the ups and downs and give myself the time to build up my experience.
Here's a quote that motivates me to dive right into coding: 
> “For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.”

Here are a few cmd line tools I've already learned a bit more about:
```
cd
ls
cat 
pwd
```
